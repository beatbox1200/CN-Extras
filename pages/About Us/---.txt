## **About CN Extras**  
CN Extras is a dedicated **Twitch channel** that seeks to **fully revive the Check it 3.0 era of Cartoon Network (2013–2015)** in every way possible. Our goal is to **recreate the experience of watching Cartoon Network** during this time, from the **programming and bumpers** to the **graphics, transitions, and overall presentation** that made this era stand out. While Check it 3.0 is the main focus of our project, our lineup also includes a **blend of shows from Check it 1.0**, the **newer shows that aired during Check it 3.0**, and a **selection of classic series** spanning from **Boomerang’s library** and the **CN City era**. This balance keeps the network fresh while staying true to the heart of Check it 3.0.  

Beyond just streaming shows, CN Extras is committed to **authenticity**, ensuring that everything—from the **bumpers, promos, and voiceovers** to the **scheduling and network branding**—matches the real experience of Cartoon Network from that time. We have even worked to **restore and archive rare Check it 3.0 bumpers**, some of which haven’t been seen in years, so they can be properly preserved and enjoyed again.  

In addition to the broadcast, CN Extras operates a **private media server**, which serves as our hub for an **extensive collection of television shows, bumpers, promos, and other materials** that help us maintain the quality of the channel. Thanks to this carefully curated library, we are able to provide an **accurate and seamless viewing experience**, keeping CN Extras as close to the real thing as possible.
